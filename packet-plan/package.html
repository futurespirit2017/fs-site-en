                        <h5 class="cl-main">「Their fast and accurate respond during times in need really helped us」</h5>
                        <p>We chose Future Spirits because when we first started our business here, they acted so much more swiftly, as compared to other hosting companies, to assist us in setting up email accounts for our staff members. They meet the deadline and completed all works as promised. Even after the initial setup, they provide us constant support through phone and emails in Japanese. They also provided English support when they are dealing with our local staff members.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <h5 class="cl-main">Q1 Please tell us how did you find out about us.</h5>
                        <p>It so happens that our office were in the same building and during that time, we needed assistance in acquiring a new domain and setting up our mail server, that was how we started approaching Future Spirits. We chose Future Spirits because we were rushing to start off our business operations and hurrying to set up email accounts for our staff members. They were the fastest to respond and delivered what was promised to us, on time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <h5 class="cl-main">Q2 What would you say is the biggest advantage, ever since you started using Future Spirits's services?</h5>
                        <p>The biggest advantage I would say, is that they are always easy to consult with. Moreover, they are always responsive and reacted quickly to our requests, especially at times when we are facing difficulties. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <h5 class="cl-main">Q3 Can you elaborate on why you say they are easy to consult with.</h5>
                        <p>Certainly. First of all, we can always consult them in Japanese or English through phone or email. Even without the necessary details at first, they are patient in hearing us out, learn the situation and finally provide us with specific and useful advice. When the information we supply is insufficient, they always guide us into providing the necessary supplementary information. Due to that, we always have a sense of security with them.</p>

                    <div class="item">
                        <h5 class="cl-main">Q4 Do you have any messages to the viewers of this content?</h5>
                        <p>In the case of Japanese corporations in Malaysia, most of the time there are no in-house IT support staff. Regardless of whether it is a Japanese or local staff, oftenly the person has to focus on their main duties while devoting their time to IT operations. It really helps when we have a partner who speaks our language during times of trouble. </p>
